To change video inputs, you can either change the video_name_path variable in main.cpp or change the video title to hand.mp4

When running the program, please make sure all files are included in the project before building the solution.

To increase the speed of the video processing, you can increase the number of frames skipped in main.cpp by adjusting skip_frames, which will make video processing faster if needed.

Can use batch script or run from IDE
